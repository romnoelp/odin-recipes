    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h2>Waffle:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅔ cups milk</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, separated, divided</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2/3 cup blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups blueberries</li>
      <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the waffles: In a medium bowl, whisk together milk and egg yolks.
        Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in melted butter and let
        stand for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly grease and preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's
        instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff. Fold
        into batter with blueberries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, scoop portions of the batter onto the preheated
        waffle iron. Cook each waffle until golden brown and the iron stops
        steaming, 4 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir blueberries, 1/4 cup orange juice, and
        honey together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix remaining 1/4 cup orange juice and cornstarch together in a small
        bowl; stir into the blueberry mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until
        thickened. Serve warm over waffles.
